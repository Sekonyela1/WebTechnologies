Web Technologies Part 2, Implementation of a game
Whack-a-Mole 
1. Overview: 
The primary objective of this task is to create the implementation of the classic game, Whack-a-Mole, in full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will be developed so that it becomes interesting to the user yet interactive enough, showing skills in the client-side web programming. 
The Whack-a-Mole game is a very common arcade game. Players must whack the moles that are alternatively popping out of their holes, scoring points over every successful hit, while avoiding hitting other objects or missing the moles at all. The general game appearance contains a matrix of holes with an arced hammer for striking and, of course, animated moles that rise and fall randomly. 
Some of the key feature points to be added for this project are a very user-interactive and engaging game interface with colourful graphics. The game layout includes creating a gridded space depicting mole holes, mallets for hitting or a cursor for clicking onto a mole, and animated moles that show up randomly every small interval and disappear.
